Hi, 
Some of my tests that involve sprites arbitrarily fail sometimes.
I am certain that it isn't my code (game code) that is causing but 
something to do with how images are loaded and drawn while testing.

The tests will run normally after the first 3 or 4 which often fail.
So if you are able to when marking please run the tests at least 3-4 times. 
Thanks
